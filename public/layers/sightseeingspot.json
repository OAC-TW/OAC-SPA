Stone Weir is an old fishing method performed by the local fishermen. By forming piled rock walls in an intertidal zone with small openings, the stone weir is designed to trap fish and leave them floundering as the tide went out. At high tide, the fish swim into the weir with the rising seawater and are trapped there when the water ebbs again at low tide. It is a sustianable fishing method since it only traps bigger fish and let go of the small ones.\nTo this day, local fishermen still patrol the stone weir and check its maintenance on daily basis to prevent the stone weir from collapsing since the piled rock walls could be damage by ocean currents and strong winds. \n",

While not as massive as some other tunnels in Kinmen, it's nevertheless well-equipped with a command post, howitzer base, pill box, anti-aircraft artillery base, dormitory and even a kitchen. In the tunnel, statues help bring to life how soldiers defended Kinmen in the era of martial law. There's also an M41 tank in the tank bunker for you to examine. The tunnel is 560 meters long, divided into two sections by the Zongxing Pavillion. The section towards the sea was controlled by the military to enable them to closely monitor Lialo Bay. The other section leads to the Zhongyi Village Office, and was used as an air raid shelter. This division of the tunnel's functions illustrates the close relationship between the military and civilians in the past.Now normally a peaceful quiet beach, every year in July or August, it becomes a bit livelier during the Jinhu Beach Clam Season. Check the Events page for details, including the date of a music concert held at the beach.If you're in Kinmen between April and June, another good reason to visit Chenggong Beach is to see the Sea of Stars natural marine phenomena.  Go at night, within three days before or after the first day of the lunar month, and when the wind is from the south. If the conditions are right, Chenggong Beach provides an easily accessible and safe place to view this spectacular natural light show.",

				"CToldescribe": "沿青岐海岸南行，可到達最南端的南山頭，此地由柱狀玄武岩構成的峭壁，氣勢雄偉、極富景觀之美。玄武岩抵擋強烈的西南季風，護衛烈嶼的南方海岸，為絕佳之天然屏障。各地的玄武岩因為成分不同,顏色或多或少會不同.比如峇厘島的玄武岩是純黑色的,南山頭的玄武岩則是灰黑色的.漳州火山地質公園一樣有玄武岩,但外觀也是跟南山頭的玄武岩不同,各有特色.岩石主要分成火成岩,變質岩,沉積岩三大類.火成岩是岩漿冷卻所形成.沉積岩是岩石風化後的沙粒慢慢堆積結塊之後所形成的岩石.變質岩則是火成岩跟沉積岩經過高溫高壓之後所轉變而成的岩石.火成岩又分火山岩跟深成岩.火山岩是岩漿噴出地表之後冷卻所形成;深成岩則是岩漿在地底慢慢冷卻所形成. 青岐及南山頭的玄武岩是1300萬年前古火山噴發出地表的岩漿所造成. 因此南山頭的玄武岩是屬於火成岩中的火山岩.烈嶼地質公園預計規畫有東崗,青岐港,南山頭,沙溪堡,貓公石,麒麟山6個點,每個點各具特色. 其中麒麟山雖然同樣是玄武岩,但因為位在烈嶼最高點,地理位置優越,另具特色,因此也列為地質公園的範圍內.柱狀玄武岩外面的格線是節理,節理形成之後才因為風化作用慢慢產生洋蔥狀風化,也因此洋蔥狀風化都各自發生在節理的格線裡面. 所謂的節理是岩漿冷卻收縮時所造成.洋蔥狀風化則是岩石形成之後,因為空氣及水的滲透所造成. 因此洋蔥狀風化是發生在節理形成之後.南山頭玄武岩上部是紅色的,而下部是灰黑色的原因是因為上部長久暴露於外,而風化作用最先從上部開始,也因此上部最先開始氧化風化成紅色. 而下部的玄武岩因為受到上部的隔絕保護,受到風化的程度較小,也因此較能維持原本的灰黑色.南山頭的玄武岩因為風化及海洋侵蝕的關係,會慢慢崩塌.在玄武岩底部鋪設沙子或可減緩海洋侵蝕,但洋蔥狀風化則無法避免,順其自然即可.南山頭海邊亦有砂岩及褐鐵礦.南山頭的砂岩(即金門層)原本位在玄武岩底下,因上面的玄武岩受到侵蝕才逐漸裸露出來. 砂岩上面的黑色條狀物推斷為古植物炭化後的化石.而褐鐵礦邊緣則疑似有古植物樹根及樹幹的石化物化石,其內部有炭化現象. 這些化石都非常脆弱,請遊客經過時須特別小心.",
				"EToldescribe": "Traveling south along the Qingqi coast, you can reach the southernmost tip of Nanshantou, The cliffs made of columnar basalts here are majestic and rich in landscape beauty. Basalt resists the strong southwest monsoon, protects the southern coast of Lieyu, and is an excellent natural barrier.The basalts in different regions are more or less different in color because of their different compositions. For example, the basalt of Bali is pure black, and the basalt of Nanshantou is gray-black. Zhangzhou Volcanic Geopark also has basalt, but its appearance is different from the basalt of Nanshantou and has its own characteristics.Rocks are mainly divided into three categories: igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks, and sedimentary rocks. Igneous rocks are formed by magma cooling. Sedimentary rock is the rock formed after the weathered sand particles slowly accumulate and clump. Metamorphic rocks are rocks transformed from igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks which after high temperature and high pressure.Igneous rocks are divided into volcanic rocks and plutonic rock. Volcanic rocks are formed by the cooling of magma after being ejected from the surface, and plutonic rock are formed by the slow cooling of magma under the ground. The basalts in Qingqi and Nanshantou are caused by the magma erupted by ancient volcanoes 13 million years ago,so the basalts in Nanshantou are volcanic rocks in igneous rocks.Lieyu Geopark is expected to have 6 locations in Donggang, Qingqi Port, Nanshantou, Shaxibao, Maogongshi and Qilin Mountain. Each location has its own characteristics. Among these locations, although Qilin Mountain is also basalt, because it is located at the highest of Lieyu , it has a superior geographical position and unique characteristics, so it is also classified as a geopark.The grid outside the columnar basalt are joints, after the joint formation, the onion-skin weathering slowly occurs due to the weathering, so the onion-skin weathering occurs in the joint grids. The joints are caused by magma cooling and shrinking. Onion-skin weathering is caused by the infiltration of air and water after the formation of rocks. So the onion-skin weathering occurs after joint formation.The upper part of Basalt in Nanshantou is red, the reason why the lower part is gray-black color is because the upper minister has been exposed to outside The weathering starts first from the upper part, and therefore the upper part begins to oxidize and weather into red. The lower part of the basalt is protected by the upper part and is less weathered, so it can maintain the original gray-black color.The basalt in Nanshantou will slowly collapse due to weathering and ocean erosion. Laying sand on the bottom of the basalt may slow down the ocean erosion, but onion-skin weathering cannot be avoided, just let it be.There are also sandstone and limonite in the seaside of Nanshantou. The sandstone (Kinmen layer) of Nanshantou was originally under the basalt, and it was gradually exposed due to the erosion of the basalt above. The black strips on the sandstone are fossils which inferred to carbonization of ancient plants. The fossils of the roots and trunks of petrochemical ancient  plants are suspected at the edge of limonite, it has carbonization inside. These fossils are very fragile, so visitors must be very careful when passing by.",

In the notion that everything has anim, the high-convex cities and low-lying gods on the surface have defensive functions and maintain the safety of the people in the city. People worshiping the city is also a natural behavior. In the Ming Dynasty, Jinmen City was set up to guard the imperial thousand households. It was a city with many residents, and naturally there was also a Chenghuang Temple that guarded the city and guarded the gods. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Kinmen City was destroyed by bandits and wars, and was rebuilt here in the Qing Dynasty.",
